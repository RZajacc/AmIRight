# Am I right

## Description
For anyone who whatched "How I met your mother" serie, probably you remember the episode where Ted and Barney walk around the city with a bunch of students, and use them to judge who is right on several different subjects. Well this is the implementation of this idea. You can post a question/problem that you encountered with your friend and partner and leave it open for a public to judge if you're right, or wrong about it.
